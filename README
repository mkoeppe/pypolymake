pypolymake
==========

What is it?
-----------

The Python module pypolymake provides wrappers for `polymake
<https://polymake.org/doku.php>`_.

The language has been kept as close as possible as the original. The
following polymake construction::

    polytope> $c = cube(5);
    polytope > print $c->F_VECTOR;
    32 80 80 40 10

is translated in Python as::

    >>> from polymake import *
    >>> c = cube(5)
    >>> c.F_VECTOR()
    (32, 80, 80, 40, 10)

The library is currently under development. Many things are not working and are
likely to cause segmentation fault.

Installation
------------

If Polymake (or its dependencies) are installed in a nonstandard
location, first set and export CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS accordingly::

    $ export LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/lib/dir $LDFLAGS"
    $ export CXXFLAGS="-I /path/to/include/dir $CXXFLAGS"

Also, in particular on OS X, make sure that libperl is found.  The
correct library directory can be found by typing::

    $ perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ldopts
    -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -fstack-protector  -L/System/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE -lperl

Use this information as follows::

    $ export LDFLAGS="-L/System/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE/ $LDFLAGS"

The package can now be installed through PyPI via::

    $ pip install pypolymake --user

Alternatively, you can download (or clone) this repository and run the
command::

    $ python setup.py install --user

Installation within Sage
------------------------

Within "sage -sh", all environment variables are automatically set
correctly.

The package can be installed through PyPI via::

    $ sage -pip install pypolymake --user

(the `--user` argument make the installation in your home directory and can be
omitted if you have write access to your Sage installation).  Alternatively,
you can download (or clone) this repository and run the command::

    $ sage -python setup.py install --user

On OS X, you need to make sure that libperl is found::

    $ sage -sh
    (sage-sh) $ export LDFLAGS="-L/System/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE/ $LDFLAGS"
    (sage-sh) $ python setup.py install --user

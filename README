pypolymake
==========

What is it?
-----------

The Python module pypolymake provides wrappers for `polymake
<https://polymake.org/doku.php>`_.

The language has been kept as close as possible as the original. The
following polymake construction::

    polytope> $c = cube(5);
    polytope > print $c->F_VECTOR;
    32 80 80 40 10

is translated in Python as::

    >>> from polymake import *
    >>> c = cube(5)
    >>> c.F_VECTOR()
    (32, 80, 80, 40, 10)

Installation
------------

To install pypolymake you currently need Sage but the library is mostly Sage
agnostic. The package can be installed through PyPI via::

    $ sage -pip install pypolymake --user

(the `--user` argument make the installation in your home directory and can be
omitted if you have write access to your Sage installation).  Alternatively,
you can download (or clone) this repository and run the command::

    $ sage -python setup.py install --user

On OS X, need to make sure that libperl is found::

    $ sage -sh
    (sage-sh) $ export LDFLAGS="-L/System/Library/Perl/5.18/darwin-thread-multi-2level/CORE/ $LDFLAGS"
    (sage-sh) $ python setup.py install --user
